# Anga FX

* Admin publish
* Admin standalone (requires validation and models)

## Work Flow

* CLI setup app
* Run
* Setup Page that asks to create admin user
* Setup Admin user
* Confirm config/setup
* Allow user to create new users and roles
* Allow users to login
* Allow developer to define a new model in project
* Allow user to define a new model in browser?
* Generate that model, clear cache if running app
* REST API Endpoints for those models

### Dev Model Generator

CLI tool to generate skeleton model

### Dev Form Generation

Forms for the app? Need to decide how that plays out.

### Roadblocks

* Validation (node version/browser version) Not really
* Models (node vs browser)
* Server Side Rendering/Client Side Hydration
